# 🌐 SkyWars 🌐
Plugin for Nukkit that adds SkyWars to your server/network.

## 🧪 Goal
Sometimes using a game plugin is somewhat complicated for different reasons such as: the method of entering the game is not the same as that of the other games, no compatibility with the main permission's handler, using other plugins to add in-game cosmetics can sometimes be chaos, etc.</br>

The goal of this plugin is not focused on offering a plugin with all the features that a server/network wants, this plugin offers the systems and gameplay of a SkyWars, yes, but it also offers an extension system that allows servers/networks create own features and integrate them directly into the game while maintaining compatibility and synchronization. Cool! Imagine creating an extension that adds Custom Cages to the plugin or even better create an extension that adds Cages, Kits, Death Effects, etc.
