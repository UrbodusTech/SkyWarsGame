# Explanation of extensions
Extensions are an easy way to customize SkyWars without having to modify the main plugin and keeping the original support. <br>

Our basic goal when creating this plugin was to maintain a neutral and basic foundation of the game and allow server creators to decide the direction of customization with the extensions.<br>

The SkyWars plugin can also work on its own without extensions as mentioned above it has all the actions of the game.

To install an extension you must place the .jar inside plugins/SkyWarsGame/extensions/

All extensions generate a data folder in plugins/SkyWarsGame/ext-dat/ you can use the folder to save configs, files or whatever the extension needs.
