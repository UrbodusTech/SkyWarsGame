# Explanation of extensions
Extensions are an easy way to customize SkyWars without having to modify the main plugin and keeping the original support. <br>

Our basic goal when creating this plugin was to maintain a neutral and basic foundation of the game and allow server creators to decide the direction of customization with the extensions.<br>

The SkyWars plugin can also work on its own without extensions as mentioned above it has all the actions of the game.
